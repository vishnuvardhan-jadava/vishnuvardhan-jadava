- 🛠️ **Skills:** My toolkit is a blend of cutting-edge technologies and traditional methods. From Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy) to SQL, from TensorFlow to Apache Spark, I thrive on the diversity of tools available in the data science ecosystem. I'm equally comfortable with statistical analysis as I am with building complex machine learning models.
